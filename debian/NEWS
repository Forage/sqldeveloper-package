sqldeveloper-package (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

    Packages built with previous versions are NOT COMPATIBLE with the ones
    built with this version. The correct update path should be:
    - Download the same Oracle SQL Developer version as the one installed,
      from Oracle's download page
    - Build sqldeveloper-<upstream version>.deb package with
      make-sqldeveloper-package from version 0.5.0 or newer
    - Fully uninstall the previous sqldeveloper.deb package (user
      configurations will not be deleted)
    - Install sqldeveloper-<upstream version>.deb and, if it was created,
      libjnidispatch-<upstream version>_<your arch>.deb

    Multiple versions can now coexist, "sqldeveloper.[upstream version]" will
    invoke a specific version of Oracle SQL Developer while "sqldeveloper"
    takes advantage of Debian's alternatives system and, when left in auto
    mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.

    Since SQL Developer v4.1, Oracle has started to include i386 and amd64
    shared libraries in NetBeans Platform modules. make-sqldeveloper-package
    is now Multi-Arch compatible and will generate new packages
    libjnidispatch-<upstream version>_<arch>.deb that will recommend, and be
    recommended, by sqldeveloper-<upstream version>.deb.

    Oracle CLI for SQL Developer, a non-gui interface for scripting or
    headless control of Oracle SQL Developer is now accessible. Following the
    multiple versions coexistence concept, "sdcli.[upstream version]" and
    "sdcli" will behave as described above.

    Since SQL Developer v4.2, Oracle started to bundle Oracle SQL Developer
    Command-Line (SQLcl) with Oracle SQL Developer. When available, and as an
    alternative to the standalone package (see "sqlcl-package"),
    make-sqldeveloper-package will make it accessible. Since there is a name
    conflict with content of package "parallel", the upstream binary "sql"
    will be renamed, and following the above multiple versions coexistence
    concept, "sql.[upstream version].bundled" will invoke a specific SQLcl
    version while "sqlcl.bundled" takes advantage of Debian's alternatives
    system and, when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest bundled
    version installed, and "sqlcl" (the recommended invocation) will invoke
    the highest version installed (either standalone or bundled, in this
    order).
