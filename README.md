## sqldeveloper-package for Debian and derivatives

**`sqldeveloper-package`** is a small script that will build a [_Debian_](http://www.debian.org) [_package_](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29) from [_Oracle_](http://www.oracle.com)_'s_ [_SQL Developer_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/).

This utility makes it possible to build a _Debian_ package of _Oracle SQL Developer_. The _Oracle SQL Developer_ program is governed by the copyright holder (_Oracle USA, Inc._), so you may be limited as to what you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This utility will simply help you create the _Debian_ package, it is your responsibility to use the resulting package acordingly with the [_OTN license_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/sqldev-license-152021.html), a copy of which is included in the created package, that you must agree on when downloading the source.

This utility will require you to download the **architecture independent** archive from [_\<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer\>_](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer), identified as "**_Oracle SQL Developer for other platforms_**", "**_Oracle SQL Developer for Multiple Platforms_**" or "**_Oracle SQL Developer for Linux and Unix_**" (depending on which version you are building), to create the _Debian_ package from.
