The Debian Package sqldeveloper-package
---------------------------------------

In order to run Oracle SQL Developer you'll need a full working JDK. The
versions that are compatible with SQL Developer are any JDK 1.5.0_06 or above
or JDK 1.6.0_03 or above for SQL Developer versions up to 1.5.5. SQL Developer
versions from 2.1 to 3.1 are compatible with JDK 1.6.0_11 or above and SQL
Developer version 3.2 is compatible with JDK 1.6.0_04 or above. SQL Developer
version 4.0 is compatible with JDK 1.7 (JDK7.0) series and SQL Developer
versions from 4.1 to 17.3 are compatible with JDK 1.8 (JDK8.0) series or
newer.

Note that Oracle SQL Developer prior to version 4.0 is not compatible with JDK
1.7 (JDK7.0) or newer and prior to version 4.1 is not compatible with JDK 1.8
(JDK8.0) or newer.

There are several ways to obtain a compatible JDK:

- install default-jdk (java), making sure it depends on the required JDK
  version
- install one of the required openjdk-6-jdk, openjdk-7-jdk, openjdk-8-jdk or
  openjdk-9-jdk (java)
- install the meta-package java-sdk, making sure that it installs the required
  JDK version as dependency
- install one of the meta-packages java6-sdk, java7-sdk, java8-sdk or
  java9-sdk, making sure that it installs the required JDK version as
  dependency
- download and run the installer for the version you wish to install from
  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>
- install java-package (contrib/misc) and generate a Debian package from the
  above installer

After installing a compatible JDK simply launch SQL Developer through the
graphical interface or by invoking /usr/bin/sqldeveloper and supply the path
where the JDK was installed when prompted.
