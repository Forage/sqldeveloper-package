The Debian Package sqldeveloper-package
---------------------------------------

In order to run Oracle SQL Developer you'll need a full working JDK. The
versions that are compatible with SQL Developer are any JDK 1.5.0_06 or above
or JDK 1.6.0_03 or above for SQL Developer versions up to 1.5.5. SQL Developer
versions from 2.1 to 3.1 are compatible with JDK 1.6.0_11 or above and SQL
Developer version 3.2 is compatible with JDK 1.6.0_04 or above.

Note that Oracle SQL Developer is not compatible with JDK 1.7 (JDK7.0).

There are several ways to obtain a compatible JDK:

- install default-jdk (java), making sure it depends of a version 6 JDK
- install openjdk-6-jdk (java)
- install the meta-package java-sdk, making sure that it installs a version 6
  JDK as dependency
- install the meta-package java6-sdk, making sure that it installs a version 6
  JDK as dependency
- download and run the installer for the version you wish to install from
  Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>
- install java-package (contrib/misc) and generate a Debian package from the
  above installer

After installing a compatible JDK simply launch SQL Developer through the
graphical interface or by invoking /usr/bin/sqldeveloper and supply the path
where the JDK was installed when prompted.
