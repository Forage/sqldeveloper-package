The Debian Package sqldeveloper-package
---------------------------------------

In order to run Oracle SQL Developer you'll need a full working JDK. The
versions that are compatible with SQL Developer are any JDK 1.5.0_06 or above
or JDK 1.6 Update 3 or above. Specifically Oracle SQL Developer will not run
with JDK 1.6 Update 1 or Update 2.

The free JDKs included in Debian, default-jdk and openjdk-6-jdk (both only for
testing and unstable) are not fully compatible: the first isn't recognized as a
SDK, and the second makes SQL Developer generate a wrong version warning
whenever it starts.

There are several ways to obtain a compatible JDK:

- download and run the installer for the version you wish to install from Sun
  <http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/>
- install java-package (contrib/misc) and generate a Debian package from the
  above installer
- install sun-java5-jdk (non-free/devel) or sun-java6-jdk (non-free/devel for
  testing and unstable, backports/non-free/devel for stable) 

After installing a compatible JDK simply launch SQL Developer through the
graphical interface or by invoking /usr/bin/sqldeveloper and supply the path
where the JDK was installed when prompted.
